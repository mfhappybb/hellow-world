GitHub Tutorial

8/5/21
Hello Humans! 

I am an extreme beginner trying to get into web development/ really any type of coding based development in the long run (robots seem cool lol)
I have already taught my self basic to intermediate html and css (enough to make stuff do basic stuff on the web browser) and I've done quite 
a bit of research on just learning web dev at my current job (Arborist Work) and every where has lead me to GitHub and starting my own project so 
here I am I suppose.

My First Project will be developing a website for my girl friend and her mom's cleaning service. I plan to post my progression as I go as well
as all of the questions and research resources I've used and gone through. I've heard Git is a great tool for feed back and collaboration which 
I hope is true lol


You will be able to find the progresion and other stuff I find interesting to this read.me page when I figure else what else to put, HERE:
